This is my first assignment. A webpage of my portfolio.

1. I was able to get my CSS and HTML validated successfully. I was able to add a picture and get the links to work correctly.
2. I did not ocllaborate with anyone on this project.
3. Between reading up on HTML and CSS and experimenting with them and actually implementing my website I spent 8 hours.
   The implementation itself took about 3-4 hours.
