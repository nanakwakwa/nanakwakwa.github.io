Node + Express + Mongodb Assignment 4
======

This is a basic node and express app that does 2 things:

1.  All aspects of the assignemnt except for the GET/ part have been completed as specified.

2.  I went to Jasper Degens workshop and Office hours and received help directl from Ming.

3. I spent approximately 20 hours, about 15 of which were spent trying to get mongo, node and express installed and working on my Windows machine. I then gave up and spent the rest of the time working on the assignment.
