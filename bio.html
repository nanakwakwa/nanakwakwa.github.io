	<p> You made it! </p>
	<p>	As I said on my home page, my name is Nana Kwasi Kwakwa and I am pursuing a bachelors in Electrical Engineering at Tufts University, Medford, MA.</p>

	<p>I'm from Ghana, West Africa where I studied until I decided to come to Tufts.</p>

	<p>When I'm not working on projects or hammering out problem sets I work as a student manager in an on-campus dining hall.</p>

	<p>At the end of every day I head back to my dorm, Hill Hall, where I get to plan fun activities for my residents.</p>

	<p>I love listening to music and watching movies. I'm a sucker for superhero movies. </p>

	<p>Do you want to get in touch? Send me an e-mail. We can talk about music, sports, movies, life as a Resident Assistant, engineering or anything.
